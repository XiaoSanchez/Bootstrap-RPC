# HandwrittenRPC Framework

HandwrittenRPC is an open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that facilitates seamless communication between service providers and consumers, enabling remote method invocation. The framework is built on top of Netty for efficient network communication and leverages ZooKeeper for service discovery and governance. With a focus on performance, extensibility, and robustness, HandwrittenRPC offers essential features such as load balancing, circuit breaking, traffic isolation, and more.

## Key Features

1. **Netty-based Communication:** HandwrittenRPC utilizes the Netty framework to establish efficient and reliable network communication. It implements a custom protocol to encapsulate RPC requests and responses, ensuring smooth data exchange between service providers and consumers.

2. **Load Balancing Strategies:** The framework includes a sophisticated load balancing mechanism with support for multiple strategies, including round-robin, consistent hashing, and shortest response time. The load balancing framework follows the template method pattern, allowing easy integration of custom algorithms through subclassing.

3. **Resilience Patterns:** HandwrittenRPC incorporates rate limiting and circuit breaking mechanisms to enhance the resilience of both client and server components. This safeguards the system from overload and prevents cascading failures.

4. **Traffic Isolation:** To ensure the separation of core functionalities from non-core processes, HandwrittenRPC implements traffic isolation through business grouping. This prevents interference between critical operations and peripheral tasks.

5. **Serialization and Compression:** The framework promotes code extensibility by offering multiple serialization and compression tools through the factory pattern. It employs SPI (Service Provider Interface) and XML configuration for maximum flexibility.

6. **Seamless Spring Boot Integration:** HandwrittenRPC provides a Spring Boot starter that seamlessly integrates the framework with Spring Boot applications. This simplifies the setup process and enables developers to quickly adopt and leverage the capabilities of HandwrittenRPC.

## Getting Started

To get started with HandwrittenRPC, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the HandwrittenRPC GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Dependency Setup:** Ensure you have Java and Maven installed. Include the HandwrittenRPC dependency in your project's Maven configuration.

3. **Service Provider Setup:** Implement your service providers and register them with HandwrittenRPC. Annotate your service interfaces and provide the necessary configuration.

4. **Consumer Integration:** Integrate HandwrittenRPC with your consumer applications by adding the required configuration and annotations.

5. **Load Balancing and Circuit Breaking:** Explore the different load balancing strategies and circuit breaking mechanisms provided by HandwrittenRPC. Customize them according to your application's requirements.

6. **Spring Boot Integration:** If you're using Spring Boot, include the HandwrittenRPC Spring Boot starter in your project to simplify integration and configuration.
